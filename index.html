<br><a href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.FO2Xx1K2KgQAJko9RsylTgHaEE?pid=Api&rs=1">Rick<a>: I-I get what you’re trying to say, Morty. Listen, I’m not you don’t you don’t got to worry about me trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I’m I’m not that kind of guy, Morty.
<br>Morty: What are you talking about, Rick?
<br>Rick: You you don’t have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. She she she she she’s all for you, Morty.
Morty: I don’t care about Jessica! You know what, Morty? You’re right.
Rick: Let’s forget the girl all together. She she’s probably nothing but trouble, anyways.
(Rick presses a button, activating the neutrino bomb)
Robot Voice: Arming neutrino bomb.
Morty: That’s it that’s it, Rick. I’m taking the wheel.
(Morty jumps up on Rick and starts fighting with him over control of the wheel)
Rick: Get off of me, Morty!
Morty: I’m taking charge of this situation, buddy. What’s gotten into you? I’m I’m I’m I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb What are you, crazy? person and just let you blow up the whole world.
Rick: All right, all right. I’ll I’ll land. I’ll land. I’ll land. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
(Rick deactivates the neutrino bomb and lands the cruiser in an open desert)
Rick: We’ll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the road here.
Morty: Oh, thank God.
Rick: You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.
Morty: It was?
Rick: Sure. Why not? I don’t know. You you know what, mo-
(Rick falls asleep, activating the neutrino bomb again and the earth begins to shake)
Robot Voice: Neutrino bomb armed.
Morty: Um…
